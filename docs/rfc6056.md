# RFC 6056

## Why This RFC
```
To reduce the chances of an attacker guessing the ephemeral ports selected for new transport protocol.
```

## How to do
```
obfuscating the ephemeral port selection, aka "port rndomization"
```

## Algorithms
1. simple port randomization algorithm might cause performance probolem
2. associate port selection with connection's information (remote ip, remote port, local ip), algorithm 3 or 4 might be better
