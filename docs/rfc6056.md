# RFC 6056

## Why This RFC
```
To reduce the chances of an attacker guessing the ephemeral ports selected for new transport protocol.
```

## How to do
```
obfuscating the ephemeral port selection, aka "port rndomization"
```

## Algorithms
1. simple port randomization algorithm might cause performance probolem
2. associate port selection with connection's information (remote ip, remote port, local ip), algorithm 3 or 4 might be better

## Notable
low collision rates -- at most **0.3%**, but it may depends.

```
In RFC6056:

[Allman] is an empirical study of the properties of the algorithms
described in this document, which has found that all the algorithms
described in this document offer low collision rates -- at most 0.3%.
That is, in those network scenarios assessed by [Allman], all of the
algorithms described in this document perform well in terms of
collisions of instance-ids.  However, these results may vary
depending on the characteristics of network traffic and the specific
network setup.
