# RFC 4821

### Special Values
* 1500
* 1400: fine for most tunnel protocol
* 1280: ipv6 minimum mtu
* 1220: net.ipv6.route.min_adv_mss
* 1024: net.ipv4.tcp_base_mss
* 552: net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu
* 256: net.ipv4.route.min_adv_mss
* 68: ipv4 minimum mtu

### Other Values
* net.ipv4.route.mtu_expires = 600

### MTU/MSS
* different whith protocol
* different with path between two same ends
    1. equal cost path
    2. different direction
* different with different ends
* application limit/implementation
    1. UDP Server can't receive such size data

### PMTUD
* search_low -> eff_mtu -> search_high
* Status verify
    1. Probe Success
    2. Probe Failure
    3. Probe Timeout Failure
    4. Probe Inconclusive
* Application Probing
    1. protocol self support ?
    2. implement in ip layer but data send as diff protocol
* MTU verification
    1. restore previous mtu value
        * base on packet/connection lost rate
        * other metrics
    2. low/high limit
    3. what is success/failure
    4. procotol special congestion control or self retry implementation
        * tcp fast retransmit
